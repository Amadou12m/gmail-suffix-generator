# gmail-suffix-generator

A simple email generator that uses the gmail plus suffix feature to generate unlimited email addresses which all point to one inbox.
This means u can create multiple accounts for a service while all trafic is pointed to one inbox, this is usefull for mass creating accounts.

Be aware a realy small percentage of websites don't allow these types of email adresses.
